Hi there 👋 I’m Shaheema Izzath

🎨 Aspiring UI/UX Designer and a Data Enthusiast

I enjoy building intuitive designs and analyzing data to find the best solutions.

💻 About Me

🔭 I’m currently focused on UI/UX design projects to refine my design principles and user experience skills.

🌱Currently enhancing my expertise in Data Analytics while learning React.js to strengthen my analytical capabilities and backend understanding.

👯 Eager to collaborate on Full-Stack Development (front-end and back-end) and Data Analysis projects.

💬 Ask me about wireframing, creative front-end design ideas, and data analysis & visualization.

📫 How to reach me: shaheemaizzath.designer@gmail.com
